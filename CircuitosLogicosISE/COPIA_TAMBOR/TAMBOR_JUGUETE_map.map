WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net SIETE_SEG_7_OBUF is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

      Number using O6 output only:             126
      Number using O5 output only:              85
      Number using O5 and O6:                   15
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      5
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         5
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    74 out of   1,430    5%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       104 out of   2,860    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          233
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           123 out of     233   52%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of     233    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         108 out of     233   46%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              33 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
